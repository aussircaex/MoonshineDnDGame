A sphinx who possesses great oracular powers. As an immortal being who has the power to travel forward and backwards in time, Flamewind has a non-linear view of time. She tends to speak in metaphorical terms regarding the past and future, referring to the timeline as "the river". For example, she refers to traveling back in time and changing the past as "placing a stone in the river", which causes water to flow around it, representing the ripple effect of that action.

She is also a scholar of the mysterious Draconic Prophesy, which the dragons understand as the DNA or "code" of Eberron itself. By studying it, they hope to be able to predict major events before they can happen, and enact or avert them to their advantage.

Flamewind resides in a tower that bears her name atop the library at Morgrave University.
