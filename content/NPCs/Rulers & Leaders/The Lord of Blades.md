According to [[Angelus]], the Lord of Blades is a visionary new leader among the warforged, founding a new movement and preaching revolution. His followers, the Blades, believe that the oppression that warforged suffered during the Last War was unforgivable, and the Treaty of Thronehold an insult - who, they ask, gives the flesh-people the right to "give" the warforged their freedom? Freedom given by the treaty could be revoked - and the Blades refuse to submit.

The Blades are supremacist in their beliefs, and while no place yet exists for them to migrate, they are ethno-nationalist, believing that a true warforged nation must be formed *only* for the warforged.

Whether the Lord of Blades is a specific person, multiple people, or perhaps an alias of Angelus himself is unknown.
