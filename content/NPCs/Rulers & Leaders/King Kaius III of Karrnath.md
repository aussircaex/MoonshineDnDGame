King Kaius ir'Wynarn III is the ruler of [[4 - Karrnath|Karrnath]]. A young king at 27, he was nevertheless one of the chief architects of the Treaty of Thronehold, which finally brough an end to the hundred-year-long conflict.

Kaius's father and elder brother died the same year as his birth, meaning Kaius has been king his whole life. Still, his aunt Moranna served as regent until Kaius assumed the throne at age 20.

Many Karrnathi warlords saw Kaius's efforts for peace as a sign of weakness, forcing Kaius to devote much of the time since the war's end solidifying his authority over his country.
