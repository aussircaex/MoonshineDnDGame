King Boranel ir'Wynarn is the ruler of [[2 - Breland|Breland]]. The third son of his father Boranex, he did not expect to be king, but joined the Brelish military and rose quickly in the ranks. Though a prince like him would normally be promoted simply out of nepotism, he led his troops to many successes and victories, earning his promotions as honestly as any other officer. He also became famous as a treasure hunter and explorer in Xen'drik on two separate expeditions.

Boranel's two older brothers died in battle in quick succession, and upon hearing the news his father died by suicide shortly thereafter, making Boranel king quite suddenly and unexpectedly. As king, he quickly proved highly effective - allying Breland with Zilargo is considered one of the most shrewd political moves in modern history. As a warrior, Boranel is legendary, having fought and defeated an ogre chieftain in single combat to allow Brelish refugees to flee.

His war heroism, his adventurism, his sympathetic tragic personal story, and on top of all, his aggressive but witty public personality have all combined to make Boranel *extremely* popular with the people of Breland.
