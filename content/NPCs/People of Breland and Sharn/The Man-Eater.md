The Doom of Droaam. The Horns You Get. La Muerte de los Matadores.

Nine feet tall and a proudly-naturalized citizen of [[15 - Droaam|Droaam]], the minotaur known as the Man-Eater is a fearsome and notorious gladiator and pit-fighter. Despite his proud affiliation with the upstart nation, the Man-Eater was born in the rural farmlands around Wroat, and *technically*, Droaam is not recognized as an independent nation by the Five Nations, and so *technically*, he still holds Brelish citizenship and a valid passport. This has allowed him to participate in exhibition fights all around the Five Nations.

Gladiatorial combat is a performance, and so the Man-Eater is usually featured in bouts where his ferocity and ability to handle a number of smaller opponents is on display.

As the Moonshine Gang were witness to, he also participates in illegal fights to the death, where he proved superior in combat to the drow elf [[The Purple People Eater (â€ )|the Purple People Eater]] and slew her.
