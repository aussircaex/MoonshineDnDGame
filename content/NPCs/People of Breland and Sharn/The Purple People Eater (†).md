A drow elf from the desert of Menechtarun. She fought Eagle in the pit fighting arena, and won her bout against him.

She did not speak Khorvari Common, and so her name wasn't widely known, and few people could understand her. She was given her name based on her characteristic drow elf purple skin and the belief that her people practiced cannibalism.

She agreed to participate in the Death Pit arena, where she was put up against the Man-Eater. She lost the bout, and was torn in half by the minotaur.
