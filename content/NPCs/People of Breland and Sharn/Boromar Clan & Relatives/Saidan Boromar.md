Patriarch of the Boromar Clan. A "legitimate businessman" in multiple industries, but everyone in Sharn knows he is also the top of a vast organized crime empire, engaged in racketeering, illegal combat arenas, smuggling, and the drug trade. Saidan's claws are deep within the power structures of Sharn itself - his daugher [[Ilyra Boromar|Ilyra]] is a City Councilor and his wife [[Mala Boromar d'Jorasco|Mala]] is a scion of House Jorasco.

*Update:* The party was invited by Saidan to visit him in the owner's box at his illegal underground fighting arena. There they witnessed the Death Pit fight for the month, in which the Man-Eater defeated the Purple People Eater by tearing her in half. Afterwards, he negotiated a bargain he hoped the party would accept - while Daask was weak, a new gang called the Blades was priming to move into Dura. If the party drove off the Blades, he would compensate them.

*Update 2:* The party successfully drove off the Blades from their hideout, and Angelus fled into hiding. The Boromar were grateful and paid the party 500gp and a magical suit of armor.
