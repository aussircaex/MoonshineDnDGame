Jaela Daran is an eleven-year-old girl who serves as the Keeper of the Flame, the spiritual leader of the Church of the Silver Flame, and thus ruler of [[3 - Thrane|Thrane]]. In practice, however, Jaela is young an inexperienced, so power is wielded by the Council of Cardinals and by her advisor, "Blood Regent" Diani ir'Wynarn, the heir to the royal line of Thrane (and thus would be queen if the monarchy was restored).

As the Keeper of the Flame, Jaela has prophetic powers, and is the only person capable of hearing the whispers of wisdom that come from the Silver Flame. While within the city of Flamekeep, she is afforded tremendous magical powers, but she cannot wield that power beyond the city limits.
