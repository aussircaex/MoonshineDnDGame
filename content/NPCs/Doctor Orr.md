A mad scientist who served as the party's first adversary. Deceiving needy veterans by promising medical care, Doctor Orr instead performed medical experiments on them, usually by grafting flesh onto them corrupted by the power of a daelkyr. Sometimes this was merely skin grafts, and sometimes it could be artificial limbs, or even brain-slugs to enslave the victim directly.

After the victim's deaths, they inevitably melted into a primordial, fleshy goo.

Doctor Orr was captured, but used a poison-gas-filled tooth to kill himself rather than be brought to the authorities.
