Much larger than is typical for a warforged, Angelus is a charismatic leader, responsible for forming a new chapter of the Blades in Lower Dura. Describing his burgeoning congregation as but one piece of a growing movement, Angelus speaks of a mythical leader called the **Lord of Blades**, who seeks to raise the warforged out of oppression by force. He believes, according to Angelus, that the warforged can only achieve freedom by seizing their independence with strength of arms and magic, and that all non-warforged are enemies to the cause, intentionally or otherwise.
