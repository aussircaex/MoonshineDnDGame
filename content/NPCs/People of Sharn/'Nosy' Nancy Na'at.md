Nancy is a reporter for the Sharn Inquisitive; the city's best-selling newspaper. She is also sometimes called "the Vulkoori Vulture" by people not fond of muckrakers like her.

She has a knack for getting "phantom" assessments of newsworthy events and people. That is, she's often able to gather information and take interviews without the subjects being aware that a reporter visited. Standing out in the crowds of Sharn with her uncommon skin color only adds to her reputation.

As is typical for drow elves, she is highly sensitive to sunlight, so she always wears her trademark magical sunglasses.
