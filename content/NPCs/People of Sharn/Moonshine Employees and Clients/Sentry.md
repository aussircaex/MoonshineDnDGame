A warforged veteran who showed up to Moonshine for assistance with a lingering hip injury. He was offered a position working at the clinic to cover the night shift and to help incentivize more warforged to use their services.

*Update:* Sentry was sent to negotiate with Angelus and the Blades, who attacked and wounded him. He made it safely back to Moonshine and is recovering from his injuries.
