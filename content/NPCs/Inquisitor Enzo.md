An Inquisitor of the Silver Flame from Thrane. Enzo was sent to Sharn in pursuit of Sanford "the Summoner", a man with an aberrant dragonmark that causes him to uncontrollably summon demons. Sanford was kept in an asylum for his safety and that of others, but Sanford viewed it as being imprisoned. When he learned of [[Doctor Orr]]'s promises of radical medical solutions, he escaped the asylum and fled to Sharn and sought out Orr's services.

Orr excoriated Sanford's dragonmark, but when Enzo and the party caught up to him, the stress revealed the truth: a dragonmark cut from the flesh will simply emerge elsewhere, and demons were summoned that killed innocent civilians. Enzo intended to apprehend Sanford, but when cornered, Doctor Orr's surgery transformed Sanford into a gibbering mouther, and Enzo and the party were forced to slay him.

Enzo soon boarded a train to return to Thrane, but put in good word with the Church of the Silver Flame on the party's behalf.
