The Boroman Clan is a family of halflings who form one of the most powerful criminal organizations in Sharn. They are active in multiple legitimate enterprises, but everyone in Sharn knows they also are a vast organized crime empire, engaged in racketeering, illegal combat arenas, smuggling, and the drug trade.

One such illegal business is their combat arena in Lower Dura, which Eagle has participated in. They also occasionally sponsor fights to the death, which the party witnessed.

Notable members:
[[Saidan Boromar]] - patriarch of the clan.
[[Mala Boromar d'Jorasco]] - wife of Saidan, ambitious and scheming.
[[Marco Boromar]] - son of Saidan and Mala and a consigliere of their operations.
[[Ilyra Boromar]] - daughter of Saidan and Mala, and a City Councilor in Sharn.
