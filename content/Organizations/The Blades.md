The Blades are a racial-supremacist organization that believes that the oppression that warforged suffered during the Last War was unforgivable, and considers the Treaty of Thronehold an insult - who, they ask, gives the flesh-people the right to "give" the warforged their freedom? Freedom given by the treaty could be revoked - and the Blades refuse to submit.

The Blades are supremacist in their beliefs, and while no place yet exists for the warforged to call a homeland, they are ethno-nationalist, believing that a true warforged nation must be formed *only* for the warforged.

The Blades are said to be led by a messianic figurehead called [[The Lord of Blades|the Lord of Blades]]. In Sharn, their local leader and preacher is [[Angelus]].![[thebladessymbol.webp]]
