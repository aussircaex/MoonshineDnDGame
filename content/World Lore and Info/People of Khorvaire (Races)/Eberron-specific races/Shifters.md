Shifters are to lycanthropes as tieflings are to fiends. That is, they have distant ancestry with were-creatures, but are otherwise ordinary humanoids with no affiliation to their “monstrous” heritage.

Shifters always appear somewhat more animal-like than humans, but not to the degree of animal-folk like [[Harengon|harengon]] or [[Tabaxi|tabaxi]]. In addition, they can “shift” to temporarily gain more animalistic features, such as sharp claws or faster-running legs.

A large number of shifters were killed during the Silver Purge due to being associated with were-creatures. Sometimes this was accidental, sometimes it was the result of hateful bigotry, and sometimes the lines between the two were blurry (it is perfectly possible for a shifter to become infected as a werewolf, after all). The shifter population has not recovered to pre-purge levels, but the Church has offered official apologies and considers the event a dark chapter in its history.

Shifters tend to live in rural areas around cities, or in abandoned areas within them.
