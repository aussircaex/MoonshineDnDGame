Orcs are indigenous to Khorvaire and have a proud history, despite never being a dominant power on the continent. Their homelands today include the [[11 - The Shadow Marches|Shadow Marches]], parts of the [[6 - The Eldeen Reaches|Eldeen Reaches]], and the [[9 - The Mror Holds|Ironroot Mountains]]. Their cultural practices vary, but the oldest druidic traditions began among the orcs, a fact they are very proud of.

Just like half-elves, half-orcs have existed as long as humans and orcs have interacted, and in general, orcs aren’t very concerned with who is or isn’t orcish “enough”, so long as they participate in their community and cultural traditions.

Half-orcs (or, mechanically, humans) bear the Dragonmark of [[Tharashk - Finding|Finding]], but if you ask an orc, they’d simply say “orcs” bear it.

Just as with half-elves, whether a given child is an “orc”, “half-orc”, or “human” is a mechanical decision; they all express variable traits of their blended ancestry, depending on the individual.
