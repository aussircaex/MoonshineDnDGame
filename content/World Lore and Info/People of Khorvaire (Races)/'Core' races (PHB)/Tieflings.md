Demons and other fiends are native to Eberron, and so tieflings have “originated” in more than one place over time. Many trace their ancestry to humans on Sarlona who made bargains with fiends for power, and many others are descended from regions with manifest zones of planes with fiendish presence (one such tribe lived around a volcano with a manifest zone to [[Fernia, the Sea of Fire|Fernia]], for example).

Most tieflings today come from long family lines of tieflings as opposed to being “new” tieflings born to humans. There are small tieflings communities around Khorvaire, especially in Sharn, but the closest thing they have to a “homeland” now lies in [[15 - Droaam|Droaam]], and many have started migrating there due to the Daughters of Sora Kell inviting “monstrous” peoples with open arms.
