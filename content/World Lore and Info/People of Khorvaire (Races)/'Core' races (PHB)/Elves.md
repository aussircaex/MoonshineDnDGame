Elves originated on Xen’drik as a product of a combination of animal husbandry and magical experiments by the Giants. They were kept as slaves for millennia, until they rebelled, and many fled to the island of [[16 - Aerenal|Aerenal]], and eventually some migrated to Khorvaire.

Elven bloodlines bear the Dragonmark of [[Phiarlan - Shadow|Shadow]], and once bore the Dragonmark of [[Vol - Death (Extinct)|Death]].

* Drow elves, aka dark elves, tend to descend from the population that did not flee to Aerenal, but plenty have found their way to Khorvaire since then. Their skin colors range from blues and purples to black.
* High/Wood/etc. elves tend to descend from the Aereni population, but for this game’s purposes, they aren’t distinct ethnicities. They bear a similar range of skin colors, facial features, and hair types to humans, other than the spiked ears.
