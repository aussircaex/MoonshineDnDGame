Humans originated on the continent of Sarlona and migrated to Khorvaire about 3000 years ago. They are the majority population in the Five Nations.

Human bloodlines bear the Dragonmarks of [[Cannith - Making|Making]], [[Orien - Passage|Passage]], [[Deneith - Sentinel|Sentinel]], and [[Vadalis - Handling|Handling]].

Humans are the most diverse of the peoples of the Five Nations, with brown skin ranging in tone from nearly white to nearly black, with black, brown, or red hair of many shades, and a variety of eye colors.
