Halflings originated in Khorvaire on the Talenta Plains, where many of them maintain their nomadic lifestyle to this day, though just as many live elsewhere in the Five Nations. They are famous for the animals they live among - dinosaurs. Halflings have domesticated dinosaurs, and they follow the herds of other species of dinosaurs that they hunt.

Halflings bear the Dragonmarks of [[Jorasco - Healing|Healing]] and [[Ghallanda - Hospitality|Hospitality]].

Lightfoot and stout and other subraces are not ethnic distinctions for this gameâ€™s purposes.
