Goblinoids were the dominant civilization on Khorvaire before humans, but their empire was already in ruin when humans arrived due to their long war with the daelkyr.

Humans drove the goblins out of what became the Five Nations, and took many goblins as slaves. The practice of slavery was ended by Galifar upon the unification of the Kingdom one thousand years ago. Therefore, somewhat like the gnomes, goblins are found in number wherever humans are found, but they are almost always an underclass living in poverty. These people are usually referred to as “city goblins”.

Goblins also form a large part of the goblinoid societies that have survived independently, discussed under [[Hobgoblins and bugbears]].
