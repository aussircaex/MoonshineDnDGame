Tortles do not keep extensive records of their history, but they appear occasionally in what history of the Dhakaani Empire remains, as well as documents from across the Kingdom of Galifarâ€™s history, describing a people not much different from the tortles of today; they live largely solitary lives traveling the coasts and rivers of Khorvaire.

When they form romantic relationships with other tortles, they tend to remain together only in the short-term. If the pairing is one that produces offspring, they remain together long enough for the children to learn to walk, upon which they all go their separate ways. Tortle couples frequently reunite with the same partner for these brief periods, but this is not a hard-and-fast rule.
