Similarly to the gnomes, harengon are descended from fey creatures that were stranded on Eberron long ago, and evolved into the humanoids they are today. However, the harengon are low in number, having been long been victimized by each power group to take over Khorvaire, whether orcs, goblins or humans, and they suffered particularly during the Silver Crusade, where many of them were killed due to widespread belief in “were-rabbits”.
