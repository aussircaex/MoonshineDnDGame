Mabar (MAY-bar), the Endless Night is the plane of negative energy. It is blackened realm where the faintest spark of light is quickly devoured by the unending darkness. More than simply darkness, Mabar represents the concept of endings and thus death â€“ the end of life, but also of heartbreak, of abandoned homes, and the loss of knowledge over time.

When Mabar is *coterminous*, nights become long and dark, and those who feed on the living become more numerous. The plane becomes *coterminous* on the three nights of the new moon closest to the winter solstice once every five years.

When history refers to a place called the Shadowfell, it is usually Mabar they refer to.

Example inhabitants: shadows, ghouls, yugoloths, shadow demons.
