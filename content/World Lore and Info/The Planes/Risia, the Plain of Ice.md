Risia (REE-see-uh), the Plain of Ice is a bleak, stagnant world of endless arctic waste. It has no liquid oceans, only vast frozen seas. Its icy mountain peaks have no earth beneath them. Within its gleaming ice, the remains of ancient civilizations are preserved for eternity.

The plane represents not merely ice and cold, but the concepts of stagnation, stillness, emptiness, and the maintenance of the status quo. It represents things that can change, but do not.

When Risia is *coterminous*, regions of cold, such as tall mountains and northern latitutes, are subject to intense cold, and elsewhere, creativity falls and systemic power is reinforced. It is *coterminous* for one month during midwinter every five years, at the same time its counterpart Fernia is *remote*.

Example inhabitants: ice devils, yetis, rhemoraz
