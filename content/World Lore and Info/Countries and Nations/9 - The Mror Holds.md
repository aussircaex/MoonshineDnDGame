The dwarven clans of the Mror Holds predate humanity's arrival on Khorvaire, and were subjugated under the rule of the Kingdom of Galifar.

Early on in the Last War, miners of the Holds discovered the vast ruins of an ancient dwarven civilization deep in the mountains, brimming with jewels, gold, and wealth of all kinds. The clans decided to share in the wealth, unite and declare themselves an independent nation. The Treaty of Thronehold recognized the independent nation.

However, the dwarves dug too deep; they discovered what had destroyed the ancient civilization - the horrific creations of the daelkyr. The dwarves have been fighting a war in the deep halls, struggling to hold onto the source of wealth that gives them their power.

The Holds fund their efforts with their vast natural resources. Most notable among the clans is [[Kundarak - Warding|House Kundarak]], who offer their services across the continent.
