Known for: agriculture, druidism, wilderness

The Eldeen Reaches were once the western frontier of Aundair, with vast farmlands and verdant forests. 

Cultural differences, particularly the practice of druidism amongst the people, meant that the people of the Reaches never felt truly "part" of Aundair. During the Last War, Aundair focused its efforts on the war, allowing the Reaches to fall to banditry and decay.

Fifty years ago, the Reaches declared their independence, leading to fighting with Aundair. The Treaty of Thronehold officially recognized the new nation, but its citizens still fear that Aundair will move to retaliate now that the larger war is ended.

The forests of the Reaches are home to small communities of uncommon peoples such as harengon, foxfolk, tabaxi, and shifters.
