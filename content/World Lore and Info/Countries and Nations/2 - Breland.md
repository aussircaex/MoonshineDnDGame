Breland is one of the “Five Nations of Galifar”, meaning they were one of the five primary belligerents in the Last War seeking to claim the throne of a unified Kingdom of Galifar.

A nation that prizes innovation, individuality, and elbow grease, Breland is one of the most socially and politically progressive places in Khorvaire. The downside to this is the preponderance of organized crime, corruption, and cynicism among its people.

Especially since the destruction of Cyre, Breland has emerged as the most technologically-advanced of the Five Nations, embracing the construction of railways, airship docks, and factories for production of all kinds.

The king, **Boranel ir'Wynarn**, is strongly beloved by the nation. His heroism in the war combined with his brash personality contribute heavily to a strong public image. However, burgeoning republican sentiment in Breland has led some to speculate that after Boranel's death, the nation may consider abandoning royal rule; a notion that frightens those who fear what the other Nations may do during such a crisis.
