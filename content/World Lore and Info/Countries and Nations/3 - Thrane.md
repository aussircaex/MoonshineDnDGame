Thrane is one of the “Five Nations of Galifar”, meaning they were one of the five primary belligerents in the Last War seeking to claim the throne of a unified Kingdom of Galifar.

The only one of the Five Nations to officially abandon its monarchy (though the queen, **Diani ir'Wynarn**, still serves as "blood regent" and advisor to the Keeper of the Flame), the nation is ruled directly by the [[3 - The Silver Flame|Church of the Silver Flame]]. The city of Flamekeep is where Tira Miron sacrificed herself to bind the demonic Overlord, and the pillar of silver fire still burns in the great Cathedral.

The nominal ruler of Thrane is instead the **Keeper of the Flame**, a single person gifted with the prophetic power to hear the whispers of wisdom of the soul of Tira Miron within the Silver Flame. However, this person is currently the 11-year-old **Jaela Daran**, and so power is largely wielded by the Council of Cardinals and Queen Diani.

Faith and religious practice is highly important to daily life of the people of Thrane, who believe that their daily prayers fuel the Flame and keep it strong.
