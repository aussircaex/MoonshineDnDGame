Known for: dragonborn, lizardfolk, jungle, prospecting

Most of Q'barra is dense jungle, and is largely populated by dragonborn and lizardfolk tribes who have lived there since the time of the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan and were never conquered by the Kingdom of Galifar.

The discovery of large quantities of Eberron dragonshards in the region have led to a "gold rush" in which the humanoids of the Five Nations have moved into the region pursuing wealth. [[Tharashk - Finding|House Tharashk]], of course, is at the forefront of such resource exploitation, which has already resulted in a good deal of environmental destruction that has displaced many of the natives, including its minority tabaxi population.
