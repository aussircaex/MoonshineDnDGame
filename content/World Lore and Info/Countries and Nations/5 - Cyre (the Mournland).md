Cyre known for: Art, invention, music, philosophy
Mournland known for: Ruins, the wall of mist, wild magic, living spells

Cyre was one of the “Five Nations of Galifar”, meaning they were one of the five primary belligerents in the Last War seeking to claim the throne of a unified Kingdom of Galifar.

Once the Kingdom's crowning jewel of knowledge, invention, and philosophy, Cyre was destroyed in a cataclysm called the Mourning, in which a shroud of dead-gray mist spread rapidly across the whole countryside, killing nearly all those inside its borders, and horribly transforming the rest. Undead creatures and warforged were not affected, but the landscape itself was magically mangled and transformed just as much as the living were.

The wall stopped spreading at Cyre's borders. No one knows what triggered it, nor what may cause it to spread once more, which led to the end of the Last War and eventually the treaty of Thronehold.

Much of modern politics is driven by the Mournland's central location driving a wedge in the middle of the continent - the Lightning Rails have no land routes available from the eastern third of the continent to the west, forcing all shipping to be done by sea or air and then by road.
