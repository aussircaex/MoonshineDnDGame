*"The gods shape and guide the world, even its more fearsome aspects”*

The **Dark Six** are the more malevolent of the fifteen Sovereigns, and as such are not directly and formally worshiped by the majority of the peoples of Khorvaire. However, their presence is respected and feared – after all, it would be unwise to disrespect the power of the Devourer, lest a storm smash your ship upon the shoals. The Six are traditionally viewed as evil, or at least as representing evil concepts.

Some philosophers and theologians, however, believe that the Six merely represent dangerous forces, not merely evil ones, and that overcoming these dangers is what allows civilization to rise above and culture to flourish. In this view, they represent the challenges the faithful must overcome to grow and mature. Without the Devourer, they say, the faithful would never have built great sailing ships to safely cross the seas.

The Six are also worshiped in more distant lands, usually identified by different names. The drow elves of Menechtarun worship a scorpion-god named Vulkoor, who strongly resembles the Mockery, and the sahuagin worship Shargon, identified with the Devourer.

The Dark Six are:
* **The Devourer** - God of nature's destructive power. He is the force of the elements, of storms, and of animals' primal savagery.
* **The Fury** - God of rage, passion, and all emotions driven to extremes. She is the goddess of revenge and hate, but also is felt in the passion of artists and craftsmen.
* **The Keeper** - God of greed, envy, and death. He is felt by all who desire what others possess, and of the suffering that that desire leads to. 
* **The Mockery** - God of dishonorable combat, treachery, and unjust war. He guides the hand of assassins and others who fight with guile.
* **The Shadow** - God of ambition, and of knowledge that should not be known. The Shadow reveals dark secrets to mages who search for them.
* **The Traveler** - God of chaos, of unavoidable change, and of dangerous gifts. Inventors and researchers make breakthroughs when the Traveler bestows them - but as it is said, "Beware the gifts of the Traveler."
