*"The gods are always with us, guiding us and shaping the world”*

The worship of the Sovereign Host is the largest collection of religions on Eberron – even the giant empires of old and the dragons are said to pay homage to them. Followers of the faith believe that the fifteen gods of the pantheon are omnipresent; that is, they are not discrete beings with bodies, but are felt everywhere in the world – every smith who swings his hammer is guided by Onatar, and every hunter who stalks their prey is kept hidden by Balinor.

The foundational myth of the Host dates back to an age when Khyber’s spawn known as the Overlords ruled the surface world. In that age, fifteen great heroes led an extensive war against the Overlords. In the end, their allies, the last children of Siberys, sacrificed most of their number to create a magical force called the Silver Flame that banished the Overlords back to the depths of Khyber and sealed them there.

Because the faith believes that the Sovereigns are felt everywhere, only the nine of them that represent benevolent forces are actively worshiped by mainstream society in the Five Nations. The more malevolent deities are known as the **Dark Six** and are recognized, but are not directly revered.

The Sovereign Host are:
* **Arawai** - God of fertility, fecundity, and the benign and bountiful parts of nature. She provides rain, good harvests, and new life.
* **Aureon** - God of knowledge and law. Thought of as the first wizard, which also means "wise man", he guides the decisions of leaders and rulers to enact good policy and laws, and assists all who seek to learn more about their world.
* **Balinor** - God of the hunt. He guides those who live between society and nature, and ensures the balance between taking what is needed from nature and its preservation.
* **Boldrei** - God of community and family. She oversees ceremonies such as marriages and inaugurations, and is considered to be present at the beginning and end of life.
* **Dol Arrah** - God of the sun and the light of truth. She guides those who fight with honor, seek justice, and put the common good before themselves.
* **Dol Dorn** - God of combat, martial skill, and the strength of ordinary people. Common soldiers and workers find courage and strength through his blessings.
* **Kol Korran** - God of trade, negotiation, and wealth. Secure trade routes, safe passage by sea, and the hospitality of strangers flow from Kol Korran, but he is also the patron of money, the love for which is, of course, the root of all kinds of evil.
* **Olladra** - God of luck and chance. Gamblers who win or lose, new businesses that flourish or fail, entertainers who chance a new act to a new audience; all of these desire the grace of Olladra.
* **Onatar** - God of fire and creation. Most often symbolically associated with the forge, Onatar is the patron of craftsmen, artificers, but also of artists, who also are engaged in acts of creation.
