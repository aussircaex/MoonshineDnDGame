*"The gods are always with us, guiding us and shaping the world”*

The worship of the Sovereign Host is the largest collection of religions on Eberron – even the giant empires of old and the dragons are said to pay homage to them. Followers of the faith believe that the fifteen gods of the pantheon are omnipresent; that is, they are not discrete beings with bodies, but are felt everywhere in the world – every smith who swings his hammer is guided by Onatar, and every hunter who stalks their prey is kept hidden by Balinor.

The foundational myth of the Host dates back to an age when Khyber’s spawn known as the Overlords ruled the surface world. In that age, fifteen great heroes led an extensive war against the Overlords. In the end, their allies, the last children of Siberys, sacrificed most of their number to create a magical force called the Silver Flame that banished the Overlords back to the depths of Khyber and sealed them there.

Because the faith believes that the Sovereigns are felt everywhere, only the nine of them that represent benevolent forces are actively worshiped by mainstream society in the Five Nations. The more malevolent deities are known as the **Dark Six** and are recognized, but are not directly revered.
