After the Progenitor Dragon Khyber slew her brother Siberys, her sister Eberron wrapped her body around Khyber and trapped her within herself. Her body is said to have become the world you live on today.

Siberys is dead, and that is why his children are few in number. His offspring are celestials, such as the unicorns and the couatls. Since his death, no new celestials are born of him, and of those who already lived, most sacrificed themselves to create the prison that binds the Overlords of Khyber.

The power of Khyber's children is strong, however, so it falls to the children of Eberron - which is to say, courageous heroes like yourselves - to combat the evils of the world.

Orbiting the planet of Eberron is the Ring of Siberys, a planetary ring (like the planet Saturn has) composed of the shredded pieces of his body. They rain to the surface periodically, and these Siberys dragonshards are highly valuable - but are only found near the planet's equator, and thus not anywhere on Khorvaire. Siberys dragonshards are gathered in northern Xen'drik, Aerenal, and presumably in Argonnessen and Sarlona.
