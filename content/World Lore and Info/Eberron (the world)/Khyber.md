After the Progenitor Dragon Khyber slew her brother Siberys, her sister Eberron wrapped her body around Khyber and trapped her within herself. Khyber's body became the realm that bears her name, also referred to as the Underdark.

Khyber is not merely "underground" - dwarves frequently live underground, but they are children of Eberron just like humans. Khyber is a realm unto itself; a place of strange, non-Euclidian pathways and chaotic landscapes. Powerful beings can shape their domains to suit their purposes, and demons and other fiends emerge from its deepest places who call themselves the Children of Khyber.

This means that many fiends are "native" to Eberron, not extraplanar beings (though such beings exist as well). The earliest parts of world history speak of an Age of Demons, where the children of Khyber ruled the world. The most powerful of these demons were the Overlords, who wielded godlike power, until the children of Eberron and Siberys rose to defeat them. The couatls - dragonlike celestial beings - sacrificed themselves to throw the Overlords back into Khyber and imprison them there. Their prison is a magic light - a silver flame - that holds the evil at bay.
