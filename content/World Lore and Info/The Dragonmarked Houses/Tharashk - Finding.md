Humans and Half-Orcs - Mark of Finding
Known for: Prospecting, Bounty Hunting Law Enforcement

House Tharashk is a Dragonmarked House whose human and half-orcish members may bear the Mark of Finding. The Mark of Finding originated amongst the half-orcish clans of the Shadow Marshes that emerged from the cultural exchange between the native orcs and migrant humans from the rest of Khorvaire. Interestingly, descendants who have enough human ancestry to no longer “count” as a half-orc may still manifest the Mark, a trait not shared by comparable Marks such as Storm and Detection. All members still trace their ancestry to the original families with mixed ancestry of orcs and humans.

Tharashk is the youngest House, being “only” a millennium old, but since its origins are in the far west of Khorvaire, it has spent a considerably small portion of its history building its economic power in the “civilized” world. Still, in the postwar period, Tharashk has begun to experience a boom, as their prospecting work has begun to discover incredible reserves of natural resources for them to exploit.

Tharashk operates their own prospecting operations, but within urban settings, they work in the bounty hunting and law enforcement industries.

Their symbol is the **dragonne**.

*n.b. - the rules say that the Mark of Finding can appear on humans and half-orcs. In my version of the world, all bearers of the Mark of Finding have mixed orcish and human ancestry - so a character who bears the Mark might be a "human" on paper, but is evidently of mixed descent; perhaps simply bearing more human-like traits compared to other members of their family.
