Gnomes | Mark of Scribing
Known for: Accounting, Archiving, Communications, Diplomacy

House Sivis is a Dragonmarked House whose gnomish members may bear the Mark of Scribing.

While not seen as glamorous, Sivis is one of the most ubiquitous Houses, as a common person is likely to interact with their areas of specialty in the course of their business â€“ Sivis employees work as notaries, translators, lawyers, accountants, and the House provides telegraph and all manner of other communications services.

While their homeland of Zilargo is notorious for its clandestine capabilities, Sivis maintains a strong reputation of trustworthiness. It is considered to be foolish for any person of wealth or power to be without a Sivis retainer to prevent mistranslations, to examine accounting records, and to review contracts and treaties.

Their symbol is the **cockatrice**.
