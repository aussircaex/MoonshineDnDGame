**Humans - Mark of Making**
Known for: Artifice, Manufacturing, Invention

House Cannith is a Dragonmarked House whose human members may bear the Mark of Making. Its members are well-known for their innovations and advancements in technology. They are responsible for the creation of many of the technological wonders of the modern era, such as the lightning rail, elemental airships, and even the warforged themselves. The house symbol is the **gorgon**, the mechanical bull creature, and its logo is a known and trusted symbol of quality for manufactured goods, both magical and mundane. They became massively wealthy during the Last War through the arms trade.

Nowadays, Cannith businesses produce relatively few consumer goods directly. Instead, the House dominates the market as the premiere original equipment manufacturer through **Fabricators Incorporated**, providing high-quality tools to independent merchants. Cannith also contracts independent repair services to those who maintain membership in the **Tinkerâ€™s Guild**.

As a result of its influence, and its status as neutral arms dealer to all nations, Cannith is considered the most powerful of the Dragonmarked Houses, and it is only second to House Kundarak in wealth.
