**Half-Elves - Mark of Detection**
Known for: Detectives, Bounty Hunters, Intelligence

House Medani is a Dragonmarked House whose half-elven members may bear the Mark of Detection. They are one of the smallest and youngest Dragonmarked Houses (being only 1500 years old).

Medani’s financial status, while still strong as a major House, are considerably weaker than their rivals due to their lack of success establishing an economic niche to monopolize. Medani agents are bodyguards, detectives, bounty hunters, and spies, but [[Deneith - Sentinel|Houses Deneith]], [[Tharashk - Finding|Tharashk]], and [[Thuranni - Shadow|Thuranni]]
have greater economy of scale in these fields. Instead, Medani focus on individual quality – their bodyguards allow fewer injuries to their clients, their detectives solve more crimes, and Medani’s spies uncover more secrets than Thuranni’s.

Their symbol is the **basilisk**.
