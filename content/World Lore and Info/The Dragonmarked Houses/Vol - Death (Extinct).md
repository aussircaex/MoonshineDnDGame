**Elves - Mark of Death**
Known for: N/A

House Vol was a Dragonmarked House whose elven members once bore the Mark of Death. The entire line was exterminated about 2600 years ago by the elves of Aerenal due to the depravity of their necromantic practices (if Aerenal's account is to be believed) While its precise powers are not known any longer, it is hypothesized that they were constructive necromantic magics such as *animate dead* or benign magics like *speak with dead* rather than directly harmful magics, which is mostly the purview of aberrant dragonmarks.
