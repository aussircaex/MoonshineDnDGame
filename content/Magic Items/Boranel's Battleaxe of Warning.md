*Weapon (battleaxe), uncommon (requires attunement)*

This battleaxe was wielded by King Boranel of Breland. It is sturdy and reliable, and he has kept it by his side for many adventures. Now, he has given it to you. You feel the strength of the Brelish Bear flow through you while wielding it (though that may just be national pride).

**Effect:** *+1*: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon

**Effect:** *Warning*: While this weapon is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you can never be surprised in combat, except when incapacitated by something other than ordinary sleep. The weapon magically awakens you if you are sleeping naturally when combat begins.
