*Wondrous item*

This is a round, flat stone about the size of a discus. You can throw the stone to a space within 20 feet that you can see, and speak the magic phrase "**that's your cue!**" Where it lands, a [[Curtain Warrior|warrior]] appears as though it stepped onto a stage from behind a curtain. The warrior fights for you and can assist with basic tasks. When the effect ends, the warrior disappears as though it exited behind a curtain once more.

**Effect**: As an action, throw the stone to a square within 20 feet and speak the magic words to summon the [[Curtain Warrior]]. See its page for details. It remains for ten minutes, or until it is reduced to 0 HP. Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until dawn after seven days have passed.

**Detail**: The stone's top side has three words written in Sylvan in an elegant script, meaning "Pay No Attention".
**Detail**: The archfey of Thelanis view everything through the lens of stories and tales. Whoever created this stone must have enjoyed seeing help arrive “just in the nick of time.”
