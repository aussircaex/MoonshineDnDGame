*Shield, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This kite shield depicts a knight in shining armor taking cover behind his shield against a dragon's fire breath.

**Effect - 3/day:** *Evasion:* When you are subject to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you may use your **Reaction** to interpose the shield between you and the effect. If you do so, you take no damage on a successful saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
