*Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)*

This round shield is made of wood and metal, with carvings of eyes adorning its face. Like all shields, your Armor Class is increased by 2 while wielding it.

**Effect**: While wearing this shield while attuned, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.
**Effect**: While wearing the shield while attuned, all ranged weapon attacks made against a target within 10 feet of you target you instead.

**Property**: When struck by a ranged weapon attack, the shield magically produces a loud “gong” noise.

**Detail**: The shield is of dwarven make, and its design suggests it was used in their battles against the monstrous denizens of Khyber.
