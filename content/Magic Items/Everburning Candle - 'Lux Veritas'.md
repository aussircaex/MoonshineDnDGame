*Wondrous item, common*

This candle is an [[Dragonshards|Eberron dragonshard]] rather than a wax cylinder, but it continuously burns as bright as a torch, shedding bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet beyond. It comes with a candle-snuffer than can cover its flame (but not extinguish it).

The candle is intelligent and can (and almost always does) speak Common. She can hear and see as far as her light shines, but not at all when covered. So long as she is uncovered, she constantly talks about how she desires to SHINE A LIGHT ON EVIL and other such heroic actions. It takes a Charisma check (DC 10) to get her to be quiet for a while. Placing her candle-snuffer on also gets her to quiet down.

She seems to believe she is the goddess [[1 - The Sovereign Host|Dol Arrah]], but begrudgingly also goes by “Lux Veritas”.![[magiccandle.jpg]]
