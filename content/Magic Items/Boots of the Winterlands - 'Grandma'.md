*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

These furred boots are snug and feel quite warm. While you wear them while attuned to them, you gain the following benefits:

•You have resistance to cold damage.
•You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow.
•You can tolerate temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can tolerate temperatures as low as -100 degrees Fahrenheit.

You must wear both boots to gain their befits.  

These particular boots are intelligent and can speak Common and Dwarven. She can communicate telepathically with someone who is attuned and is wearing both boots, and can hear the same person if they speak aloud to her, but cannot otherwise hear, see, or speak. She refers to herself as the wearer’s grandmother and fusses over making sure they wear warm clothing, have eaten breakfast, and whether they’re dating someone.
