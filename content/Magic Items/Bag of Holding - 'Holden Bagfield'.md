*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This is a large sack, four feet long and two feet in diameter at the opening. The interior space of the bag is extra-dimensionally larger than the outside, able to hold up to 500lbs or 64 cubic feet within it. It always weighs 15lbs, regardless of what is inside. Retrieving anything from the bag requires an action. **Warning**: do not attempt to place extra-dimensional storage items inside other such items!

This particular Bag of Holding has two pool-ball-sized eyes that roll around the opening of the sack. The Bag is intelligent and can speak Common, and can see and hear out to a distance of 120 feet.

He calls himself Holden Bagfield, and he desires nothing more than to be full of _things_ at all times. He will regularly pester you to put anything you find into him.
