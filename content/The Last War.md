104 years ago, King Jarot of the Kingdom of Galifar died, and while he had designated his eldest daughter as his heir, her siblings rejected her claim, and war broke out between all of [[0 - 'The Five Nations'|the Five Nations]].

The war dragged on and on - alliances were formed, shifted, and broken many times over the decades; each of the Five Nations was bitter enemies or allies of any of the others at one point or another. The war far outlasted the lives of the original claimants to the throne.

Finally, after a full century of fighting, a magical cataclysm destroyed the nation of [[5 - Cyre (the Mournland)|Cyre]] in an event called the Mourning, but the wall of dead-grey mist that heralded the destruction halted at the country's borders . Due to the cause of the event being unknown, fighting quickly was halted across the continent for fear of triggering whatever had caused it.

After two years of a tense ceasefire, the Treaty of Thronehold was signed by the surviving four of the original belligerents, among other represented parties, officially ending the war. That was in 996 YK, two years before the present day. The treaty made the current borders of the nations of Khorvaire official, and recognized a number of sovereign nations that had declared their independence during the conflict, including [[7 - Zilargo|Zilargo]], [[10 - The Talenta Plains|the Talenta Plains]], [[13 - Q'barra|Q'Barra]], [[6 - The Eldeen Reaches|the Eldeen Reaches]], [[14 - Darguun|Darguun]], and [[8 - Valenar|Valenar]]. Notably, the treaty was *not* signed by the survivors of Cyre, despite a royal heir being present, and the treaty also did *not* recognize the nation of [[15 - Droaam|Droaam]].

Effectively, none of the Five Nations are satisfied with how the war ended, and so while open armed conflict has ceased, each of the major powers is conducting operations to strengthen their position for possible future conflict - technological development, magical research, exploration of the ruins of Xen'drik for a discovery that could be a trump card, and many other avenues of power.
