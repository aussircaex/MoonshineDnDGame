Kalashtar are natives of Sarlona, the same continent from which humans migrated. While they can be considered humans in most respects, they are distinct in a very important way: each kalashtar possesses a hybrid soul - they are each a unique individual, but are also merged with the soul of a Quori - a being from [[Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams|Dal Quor]], the region of dreams. This was a willing process, and all members of a given bloodline are linked to the same Quori. This union has allowed for great spiritual unity among the kalashtar, and makes them naturally gifted with psionic power.

However, the kalashtar are an oppressed minority in Sarlona, and so many have migrated to Khorvaire over the years. They do not have lands of their own, but are numerous enough to form their own communities, neighborhoods, and occasionally villages.
