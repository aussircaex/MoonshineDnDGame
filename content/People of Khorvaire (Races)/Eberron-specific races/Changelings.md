Changelings are humanoid people with many traits similar to doppelgängers. Their natural forms have pale grey or near-white skin and light silvery or white hair, along with “faded” facial features, as if a human’s face was blurred or low-detail. Their eyes are blank and uniform in color.

However, this natural form is rarely seen, because changelings have the ability to alter their appearance to any humanoid form they like. They can change their apparent height by a foot in either direction and their apparent weight by 100lbs in either direction. This change is an actual transformation, not an illusion, but powerful magics can still reveal their true forms.

Most changelings construct identities for themselves using their powers, and its is more common than not for them to have multiple such identities, often with different expressions of personality and gender.

Changelings are relatively few in number and do not have lands or cities of their own, but are found across Khorvaire.
