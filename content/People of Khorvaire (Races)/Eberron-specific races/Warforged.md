The warforged were first built 33 years ago, and were an original invention by House Cannith. They are born in great “Creation Forges”, the mechanics of which are one of the tightest-held secrets in the world.

Most of a warforged’s body is wood - specifically livewood, which continues to live and grow after being cut. They have a metal skeletal frame and have metal and stone plating as an outer shell. They have hinged jaws and crystal eyes, and each bears a completely unique symbol on their forehead.

Warforged have no physical sex and choose their own gender expression, if they select one at all.

Some constructs are capable of limited forms of thought, but warforged are truly sapient people; while literally being constructed, not born, they are intelligent, creative, emotional, and can even be raised from the dead; a trait not shared with true constructs.

They were sold as “living weapons” during the war; in truth as slave-soldiers, and were officially freed by the Treaty of Thronehold two years ago. Many have found their way to cities seeking work or a new purpose in life.
