Tabaxi, or catfolk, have small communities wherever the big cats they resemble are found - forests, savannah, and mountains - but never in great numbers. The largest population is found in [[13 - Q'barra|Qâ€™barra]], where deforestation by [[Tharashk - Finding|House Tharashk]] and other prospectors is threatening their way of life and is beginning to bubble into violence.

Tabaxi tend to resemble the big cats found in the same environments in which they live, though they are no more related to them than humans are to apes and monkeys. Forest and jungle-dwelling tabaxi resemble jaguars, leopards or tigers, those who live on the plains resemble lions or cheetahs, and those who live in hilly or mountainous terrain may resemble cougars, snow leopards, or lions.
