Half-elves have existed as long as elves and humans have interacted. While we will usually refer to them as half-elves for simplicity, they are their own distinct people who don’t think of themselves as “half” anything, and often refer to their people as the khoravar.

Most half-elves are born to other half-elves, not human-elf pairings, but relationships between any of the three groups is widely accepted in the Five Nations. Whether a child of any given pairing is “human”, “half-elf”, or “elf” is a game-rules question; they all bear traits of their blended heritage.

Half-elven bloodlines bear the Dragonmarks of [[Medani - Detection|Detection]] and [[Lyrandar - Storm|Storm]].

Half-elves can display any of the physical traits of their ancestors, and it’s not uncommon for elves to mistake them for humans and vice-versa.
