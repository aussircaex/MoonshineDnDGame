Dwarves originated in the Frostfell, the frozen land around the north pole, and migrated to the Ironroot Mountins in Khorvaire, which remains their homeland. Their lands are called the Mror Holds.

Dwarven bloodlines bear the Mark of [[Kundarak - Warding|Warding]].

Hill/mountain dwarves are not ethnic distinctions for this gameâ€™s purposes
