Dragonborn originated on the continent of Argonnessen, where many still reside. However, the population on Khorvaire migrated over ten thousand years ago and have no ties to the people of Argonnessen any longer. Their homeland is [[13 - Q'barra|Q’barra]], but they have always been explorers and settlers, and so have communities and populations all around Khorvaire.

The majority of dragonborn have scale colors of brown, rusty reds, brass or bronze, but rarely they can have the bright coloration of their associated ancestry *(note: which is what you’ll see most often in fan artwork)*.

Dragonborn do not bear dragonmarks. The fact that they show up on humanoids of all people and NOT dragons and dragonborn is of great concern to the dragons.

*note: Per the PHB's description, they do* not *have tails, but it's so commonly seen in fan artwork, and many players assume they do have them, so I just go with "some do and some don't".*
