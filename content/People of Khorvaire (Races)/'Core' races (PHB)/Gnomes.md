Gnomes are descended from fey ancestors from [[Thelanis, the Faerie Court|Thelanis]] who were stranded on Eberron, and have since evolved into the humanoids they are today. Their homeland is [[7 - Zilargo|Zilargo]], but they have been close friends with humans since first contact, and are found in number wherever humans are.

Gnomish bloodlines bear the Dragonmark of [[Sivis - Scribing|Scribing]].

Forest and rock gnomes are not ethnically distinct for this gameâ€™s purposes.
