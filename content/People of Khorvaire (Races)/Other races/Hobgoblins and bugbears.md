Hobgoblins were the “humans” of their day, being almost as numerous as goblins but with far more societal power and influence. Bugbears have always been a minority population, serving as muscle for the goblinoid empires.

When humans settled on Khorvaire, they warred with the goblins and pushed them out of what became the Five Nations, leaving the goblins to survive in inhospitable lands on the continent’s fringes. Most hobgoblins come from these places, but have lately been migrating en masse to the new goblin nation of Darguun, and to a lesser extent to Droaam; places not only which offer them far more societal power than the Five Nations, but are far more hospitable places to live.

Goblinoid society in these palaces is not uncivilized, but is quite foreign to humans and their allies, and the goblinoids hold longstanding enmity against the humans who took their lands and enslaved their people.
