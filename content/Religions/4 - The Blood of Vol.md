*“There are no gods who can save you from the oblivion of Dollurh. Find the divinity within yourself and escape this fate”*

The **Blood of Vol**, or the **Seekers of the Divinity Within** is a decentralized religion with a variety of local rituals and practices, but uniting them is the belief that there are no gods that guide the world – to achieve divinity is to pass beyond Eberron and the planes that surround it. Since it is known that all souls of the dead travel to the plane of [[Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead|Dollurh]], the Blood teaches that the faithful can unlock divinity within themselves and ascend – unless death claims them first. The Seekers see death only as a curse, compared to other religions that accept its place in the cycle of life.

Seekers are not averse to necromantic practices – they see unintelligent zombies as making good use of the bodies of the dead to protect the living, and they see intelligent undead as martyrs who sacrifice their chance for divinity to preserve their wisdom for future Seekers.

The religion borrows its name from its founder, a member of House Vol, a dragonmarked house driven to extinction many centuries ago. The precise reason for its name has been lost even among the faithful, which led to the rise of the Seekers as an alternative name of the faith.
