*"The gods shape and guide the world, even its more fearsome aspects”*

The **Dark Six** are the more malevolent of the fifteen Sovereigns, and as such are not directly and formally worshiped by the majority of the peoples of Khorvaire. However, their presence is respected and feared – after all, it would be unwise to disrespect the power of the Devourer, lest a storm smash your ship upon the shoals. The Six are traditionally viewed as evil, or at least as representing evil concepts.

Some philosophers and theologians, however, believe that the Six merely represent dangerous forces, not merely evil ones, and that overcoming these dangers is what allows civilization to rise above and culture to flourish. In this view, they represent the challenges the faithful must overcome to grow and mature. Without the Devourer, they say, the faithful would never have built great sailing ships to safely cross the seas.

The Six are also worshiped in more distant lands, usually identified by different names. The drow elves of Menechtarun worship a scorpion-god named Vulkoor, who strongly resembles the Mockery, and the sahuagin worship Shargon, identified with the Devourer.
