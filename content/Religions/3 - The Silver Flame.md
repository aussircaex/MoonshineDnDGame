*“The Flame keeps the forces of darkness at bay, and we are its keepers and its kindling.”*

The Church of the Silver Flame is the second-largest religion in Khorvaire, being much smaller in size compared to the ubiquitous Sovereign Host, yet with a major presence in all major cities as well as the entirety of the nation of Thrane.

In the Church’s founding mythology, shared with the Host, the children of Siberys sacrificed most of their number to create a magical force called the Silver Flame that banished the Overlords back to the depths of Khyber and sealed them there.

These seals held until 600 years ago, when one of the Overlords broke free and brought ruin to Thrane, until a paladin named Tira Miron sacrificed her life to bind the demon once more. In the aftermath there remained a silver fire, which burns to this day in the city of Flamekeep. Tira’s soul persisted, and her guidance is passed to the faithful through the Keeper of the Flame, a single individual gifted with the ability to hear her.

Adherents to the Church see themselves as agents of the Flame’s purpose – protectors of the innocent, destroyers of the evil beings that threaten the world, and preservers of the magical power of the Silver Flame that protects the world. There are many warriors among its adherents, but even its lay members believe that their faith contributes to the strength of the sacred fire, and that their souls will kindle the Flame after they die.
