Part of a small religion practiced by Harengon tribes in the Eldeen Reaches, the Moon Rabbit is worshipped as a patron of the vulnerable.

Long ago, the story goes, a deity was traveling in the Eldeen Reaches, where he ran out of food. Three animals came to his aid. There was the fox, which hunted on his behalf, but came up empty. There was the squirrel, which sought to loosen nuts from the trees, but the god could not eat them. Then there was the rabbit, who threw herself into the campfire so that her body would feed the hungry god. As a reward, the god raised the rabbit to the heavens, granting him lordship of the moons.

The faithful of the Moon Rabbit do not generally consider themselves as part of faith of the Sovereign Host, but scholars from the latter religion interpret the story as being about Dol Arrah, the sun, and the story necessarily taking place during the Age of Demons when the gods walked the world. It would be within his purview to elevate the Rabbit to lordship over the moons.

As with all other deities worshipped across Eberron, no evidence of the Moon Rabbit being an extant, discrete entity exists; no one has ever seen or spoken to the Moon Rabbit himself. The divine powers provided to the faithful are taken as evidence enough by the faithful, as in other faiths.
