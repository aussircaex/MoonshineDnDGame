Humans - Mark of Passage
Known for: Courier and Mail, Railroad, Ground Transportation

House Orien is a Dragonmarked House whose human members may bear the Mark of Passage. Orien has historically dominated overland shipping, operating caravans, coaches, and taxi services, along with being in charge of courier and mail services across the Five Nations.

In the latter days of the Last War, Orien grew to its greatest prominence with the invention of the Lightning Rail, allowing for high-speed transportation across Khorvaire. The Rail network revolutionized travel and allowed for the development of mass production, promising lower prices and standardized quality.

Their hedgemony has been challenged by two factors: [[Lyrandar - Storm|House Lyrandar’s]] invention of flying airships, which allow them to compete with Orien for overland trade. Second, the Mourning severed the land route between eastern and western Khorvaire and caused the destruction of large portions of Orien’s rail networks. While the House is on the economic back foot, its considerable resources are set to finding solutions to re-establish its dominance in the modern era.

Their symbol is the **unicorn**.
