**Humans - Mark of Handling**
Known for: Animal Husbandry, Ranching, Safari

House Vadalis is a Dragonmarked House whose human members may bear the Mark of Handling. Vadalis is not usually considered among the most powerful of Houses, but its vast herds of farm animals mean it provides a large portion of Khorvaire’s food supplies and a large portion of its raw materials sourced from animals. With vast swathes of territory left vacant by the Last War, Vadalis was able to expand their grazing farmlands extensively.

Vadalis is famous for their quality – if you can afford them, Vadalis’s magebred animals are stronger, faster, and smarter than others of their kind. The Mark of Handling even allows them to train and work with creatures that normally do not respond well to domestication, such as griffons, hippogriffs, bulettes, and owlbears.

Despite rumors to the contrary, Vadalis is not the creator of such “hybrid” creatures like griffons and owlbears, all of whom have fossil records far older than the 1800 years of Vadalis’s history. However, after the creation of the warforged and especially after their manufacture has been banned, Vadalis has openly been seeking to replicate [[Cannith - Making|House Cannith’s]]success.

Their symbol is the **hippogriff**.
