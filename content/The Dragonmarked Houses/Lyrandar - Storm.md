**Half-Elves - Mark of Storm**
Known for: Shipping, Shipbuilding, Air Travel

House Lyrandar is a Dragonmarked House whose half-elven members may bear the Mark of Storm. Lyrandar is the largest seafaring trading company in Khorvaire – on the seas and rivers, none can match a Lyrandar pilot’s speed, and few can match a Lyrandar ship’s cargo capacity. They have also begun operating in the skies, contracting with the gnomes of Zilargo to utilize elemental binding to create airships.

Lyrandar’s own fleet is known as the Windwright Trading Company, and its flag flies proudly in every port. They also operate the Raincallers, who advertise weather-controlling services, but their prices are out of reach to all but the wealthiest clientele.

Lyrandar’s control of shipping has recently been challenged by [[Orien - Passage|House Orien]], who have developed their iconic Lightning Rails, and tensions between the two have been rising for years.

Their symbol is the **kraken**.
