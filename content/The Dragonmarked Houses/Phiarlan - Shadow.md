**Elves - Mark of Shadow**
Known for: Theater, Music, Entertainment, Intelligence

House Phiarlan is a Dragonmarked House whose elven members may bear the Mark of Shadow. It shares the Mark of Shadow with [[Thuranni - Shadow|House Thuranni]], which broke off from Phiarlan only a few decades ago.

Phiarlan is the largest corporation in the entertainment industry. They are the largest producers of original works in the most popular fictional properties, and they contract the most famous actors, musicians, writers, and other artists across Khorvaire. Performers who contract with the studio give up their artistic independence, but are drawn in by the allure of fortune and the possibility of becoming a star.

In addition, since Phiarlan members are frequent travelers with access to wealthy and powerful clients who commission their performances, Phiarlan is also said to operate an intelligence and information brokerage service.

Phiarlan operates in the same industries as its counterpart House Thuranni, but Phiarlan is dominant in the west of Khorvaires, and Thuranni dominant in the east.

Their symbol is the **hydra**.
