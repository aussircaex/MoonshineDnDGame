**Humans - Mark of Sentinel**
Known for: Mercenaries, Bodyguards, Law Enforcement
  
House Deneith is a Dragonmarked House whose human members may bear the Mark of Sentinel. Its members are highly-acclaimed mercenaries, bodyguards, and military consultants known for their efficiency and martial skill. Among the Dragonmarked Houses, Deneith is the muscle; it is the only one of the Houses permitted to have its own military forces. They own and operate the **Sentinel Marshals** law enforcement agency, along with the **Defenders Guild** for bodyguard services, who protect all royal families in Khorvaire.

During the Last War, Deneith provided raw power to all sides who could afford their prices. In the final decades of the War, tensions slowly grew between Deneith and [[Cannith - Making|House Cannith]], because Deneith viewed Cannith's warforged soldiers as a threat to their own monopoly on mercenary work. Cannith, in turn, considered the warforged to be glorified tools no different from swords or shovels. Due to the heavy casualties of the War, there was business enough for both Houses to prosper. In the two years since, however, tensions are rising once more, as opportunities for mercenary work are fewer, and newly-liberated warforged seek to be paid for their services.

In addition to mercenary and guard services, Deneith serves as a contractor for bounty hunting, which brings them into conflict with [[Tharashk - Finding|House Tharashk]], who also perform such services.

Their symbol is the **chimera**.
