**Halflings - Mark of Hospitality**
Known for: Inns, Catering, Brewing

House Ghallanda is a Dragonmarked House whose halfling members may bears the Mark of Hospitality. Ghallanda, unsurprisingly, dominate hospitality services: inns, hotels, hostels, and catering. While many political thinkers and power players think little of Ghallanda in the grand scheme, the house is one of the most well-connected and widely-distributed powers in Khorvaire: they operate inns in every city, and they provide food services to every army. Their franchise, the Gold Dragon Inns, are sanctuaries beyond the legal reach of any government or other Dragonmarked House. Establishments not directly owned or franchised by Ghallanda nonetheless are usually certified by their Hosteler Agency to prove they meet high standards of quality and services provided.

The symbol of Ghallanda is the **blink dog**. Folklore has it that the creature is said to appear before those in desperate need – Ghallanda’s marketing teams always insist that “when your feet are ready to give out, a Ghallanda bed will be there for you.”
