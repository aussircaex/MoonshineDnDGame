**Halflings - Mark of Healing**
Known for: Hospitals, Medicine

House Jorasco is a Dragonmarked House whose halfling members may bear the Mark of Healing. Providing indispensable healing and medical services to the many casualties of the Last War, Jorasco's services include alchemy, herbalism, doctors and nurses, and, among its more talented staff, magical healing and curative services. Their activities do not often make headlines the way other houses do, but they remain one of the most influential players in Khorvaire.

Jorasco operates its own first-party hospitals within its enclaves, and naturally, operates the Guild of Healers which educates and licenses doctors and nurses across Khorvaire.

Their symbol is the **griffon**.
