**Elves - Mark of Shadow**
Known for: Theater, Music, Entertainment, Intelligence

House Thuranni is a Dragonmarked House whose elven members may bear the Mark of Shadow. It shares the Mark of Shadow with [[Phiarlan - Shadow|House Phiarlan]], from which Thuranni broke off only a few decades ago.

Thuranni is the second-largest corporation in the entertainment industry. While they lack the large catalog of intellectual properties held by their parent House Phiarlan, they have marketed themselves as being the producers of the newest, most daring artistic productions for a new generation. They tend to draw young talent who are willing to perform for smaller audiences in exchange for the opportunity to take more artistic risks.

Thuranni is also said to offer professional assassination and other contract killing services. The House itself claims that these are merely slanderous rumors spread by House Phiarlan, who are jealous and fearful of their artistic daring. What is undeniable, however, is that Thuranni inherited a large portion of Phiarlanâ€™s intelligence network.

Thuranni operates in the same industries as its counterpart House Phiarlan, but Phiarlan is dominant in the west of Khorvaire, and Thuranni dominant in the east.

Their symbol is the **displacer beast.**
