The Five Nations, strictly speaking, are the five regions that formed the Kingdom of Galifar. They are:
* [[1 - Aundair|Aundair]]
* [[2 - Breland|Breland]]
* [[5 - Cyre (the Mournland)|Cyre]]
* [[4 - Karrnath|Karrnath]]
* [[3 - Thrane|Thrane]]

King Galifar I was king of Karrnath and conquered the other four, though in administration, they remained separate provinces. These were also the primary belligerents of the Last War.

More broadly, however, the ''Five Nations" refers to the wider human-dominated civilization that Galifar stood at the center of. So while four of the five nations survive to this day, if someone writes about, say, the history of halflings "in the Five Nations", that includes places like the [[6 - The Eldeen Reaches|Eldeen Reaches]], [[7 - Zilargo|Zilargo]], and the [[9 - The Mror Holds|Mror Holds]], and does not refer to places like [[15 - Droaam|Droaam]], [[16 - Aerenal|Aerenal]], or the [[11 - The Shadow Marches|Shadow Marches]], who are not culturally and historically linked to Galifar in the same way.
