Aundair is one of the “Five Nations of Galifar”, meaning they were one of the five primary belligerents in the Last War seeking to claim the throne of a unified Kingdom of Galifar.

Aundair has embraced magic more than the rest of Khorvaire, being the home of the most prestigious research academy on the continent – **Arcanix**. Their most elite knights are eldritch knights, they have the largest proportion of wandslingers among their law enforcement, and they have invested the most in magical infrastructure like cleansing stones in their villages.

However, much of Aundair’s strength came from the natural resources found in its western regions, which have split off as the independent nation of the Eldeen Reaches, leaving Aundair in a precarious position to maintain their manufacturing base and thus their military power.

As a result, **Queen Aurala ir’Wynarn** has proven to be one of the more aggressive leaders of the peacetime following the Treaty of Thronehold. While she does not yet have the standing forces to invade the Reaches, she has taken great risks to fund exploration, prospecting, and even colonial efforts in order to build up the nation’s strengths once more.
