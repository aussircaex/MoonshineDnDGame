Known for: fiends, volcanoes, devastation

Few living beings live in the Demon Wastes. Once the seat of power of many archfiends during the Age of Demons, the region is still blasted and poisoned by their lingering influence. What demons still exist on Khorvaire today mostly are concentrated in this region.

The Wastes proper are isolated from the rest of Khorvaire by impassible mountains, but also by powerful ancient warding magic, forcing any fiend who wishes to enter or leave the Wastes to traverse a series of canyons called the Labyrinth. The exit to this Labyrinth is guarded by the orcish clans called the Ghaash'kala, who prevent the fiends from endangering the rest of the continent.
