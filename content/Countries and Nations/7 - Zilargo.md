Known for: Gnomes, alchemy, elemental binding, espionage.

Zilargo is the homeland of the gnomes, are are longtime allies of Breland. Once a part of Galifar, and subsequently an autonomous province under Breland, it is now a fully independent nation thanks to the Treaty of Thronehold, but remains a close ally of Breland.

Zilargo is a secret-police state. Its politics are dominated by intrigue, and assassinations are common - but somewhat paradoxically, the general population is happy with this, as they belief their system has created stability, safety, and prosperity for the Zil gnomes for a millennium.

Perhaps the most notable export of Zilargo is its newspaper, the *Korranberg Chronicle*, with the most widespread network of journalists on the continent. They have a reputation as the paper of record, with reliable reporting and an editorial bias towards neutrality.
