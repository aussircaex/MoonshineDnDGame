Known for: nomadic halfling tribes, dinosaurs, herding

The vast plains of Talenta do not contain permanent cities, but rather great numbers of nomadic halflings, who travel to follow the great herds of dinosuars the halflings hunt. These same tribes also tame the beasts as mounts, and have domesticated some of them, but maintain their nomadic lifestyle nonetheless.

Talenta was once part of Karrnath, but was never tightly controlled by it, and its independence was recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold.

Both Houses [[Jorasco - Healing|Jorasco]] and [[Ghallanda - Hospitality|Ghallanda]] originated in the Plains, though they have long since spread to the rest of Khorvaire and adopted more cosmopolitan ways, and today have little in common with the nomads there.
