Known for: Eberron dragonshard prospecting, swamps, bogs, marshes, orcs.

One of the traditional homelands of the orcs, the Shadow Marches are sometimes viewed as a fetid backwater by the rest of Khorvaire, though an intriguing one for its bounty of Eberron dragonshards.

The Marches are not an officially-recognized nation by the Five Nations, and is indeed not a nation at all; it is simply the name they use for the region.

While possessing its own beauty, the Marches are certainly a difficult place to survive, being a very wet region of marshes, swamps, moors and bogs. It also bears scars of conflict with the daelkyr long ago, leaving some of the landscape even more hostile than it was.

Still, many orc tribes make their home here, surviving in the wetlands as hunters, fisherman, river-boat builders, and, where possible, rice farmers. The Marches are the birthplace of druidism on Khorvaire, and the orcs were its first practitioners, founding the Gatekeepers tradition which survives to this day.

Perhaps most notable to the people of the Five Nations is that the Marches is the origin of [[Tharashk - Finding|House Tharashk]], and their cultural ties to the region have led them to maintain certain "tribal" qualities that the other Houses find distasteful. Besides their cultural links, Tharashk perform a good deal of prospecting operations in the Marches, searching the muck and swamp-gas bubbles for Eberron dragonshards, which they ship to the rest of Khorvaire.
