Known for: elves, "deathless" necromancy, the Undying Court

The first independent homeland of the elves following their flight from Xen'drik, Aerenal is an island-continent to the southeast of Khorvaire. The Aereni are ancestor-worshippers of an unusual kind. Elves already live lengthy lives, and thus they remember ancestors who lived thousands of years ago. Even more so than this, however, is their practice of necromancy. The greatest elders of the Aereni are preserved as "deathless", a form of undeath powered by the positive energy of [[Irian, the Eternal Dawn]|Irian]], rather than the traditional negative energy of [[Mabar, the Endless Night|Mabar]]. These elders form the Undying Court, who are treated as "living" gods by Aereni society. Some of these elders are tens of thousands of years old.

Aereni society moves at a slow pace; it is the place in the world where the elves enforce *their* perception of time on society, as opposed to the elves of Khorvaire who operate on more human time-scales. The Aereni possess greater magical power than Khorvaire can muster, but they are more focused on refinement and perfection of their craft, compared to Khorvaire's focus on rapid industrialization and expansion.
