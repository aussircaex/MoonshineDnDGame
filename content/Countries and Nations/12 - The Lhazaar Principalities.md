Known for: Ships, shipping, boats, pirates

The Principalities are a loose confederacy of small-time pirate lords, merchant princes, and sea barons who constantly fight amongst themselves but ally against outside threats. They are among the finest sailors in Khorvaire, and [[Lyrandar - Storm|House Lyrandar]] recruits as many of them as they can to crew their vessels.

The Principalities were never conquered by the Kingdom of Galifar and remain independent to this day.

There is a small but growing number of half-elves born in the Principalities who manifest the Mark of Storm but otherwise have no direct ties to House Lyrandar's families. It is believed to only be a matter of time before the first *sky* pirate ships appear, helmed by these people.
