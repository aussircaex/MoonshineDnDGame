Known for: goblinoids, mercenaries.

Goblinoids once ruled Khorvaire with their Empire of Dhakaan, but the daelkyr invasion led to their eventual collapse, and the migration of humans from Sarlona led to their further disperal. Goblinoids have formed a minority population in many parts of the Five Nations ever since.

During the Last War, however, some goblins took the opportunity to seize the region now known as Darguun from Cyre. Breland negotiated an alliance with the nascent Darguun to deny it to Cyre, and that nation's destruction by the Mourning left no barriuers for the Treaty of Thronehold to recognize it as an independent nation.

Goblinoids have an old history of nation-building, but they have not done so in millennia, and as such their cultural knowledge has diminished. In addition, Darguun was founded as a military alliance of goblinoid warbands and mercenary groups, and so is highly politically unstable. It remains to be seen if the nation will be able to transition into a stable civilian government.
