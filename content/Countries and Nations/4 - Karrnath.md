Known for: Beer, martial discipline, necromancy

Karrnath is one of the “Five Nations of Galifar”, meaning they were one of the five primary belligerents in the Last War seeking to claim the throne of a unified Kingdom of Galifar.

Above all else, Karrnath is known for its military traditions: strength, discipline, and strategic wisdom are prized. They lack the magical strength of Thrane or Aundair and the technology and wealth of Breland or Cyre, but make up for it by prioritizing the capabilities of all of its soldiers, from its footmen to its knights.

When this proved not to be sufficient, however, Karrnath would turn to necromancy. The King, **Kaius III**, implemented the [[4 - The blood of vol|Blood of Vol]] as the national religion, and raised legions of undead warriors to bolster its forces. Reception to this practice is understandably mixed - those who sincerely embrace the Blood of Vol view the undead as valid beings, but many more see them as abominations.
