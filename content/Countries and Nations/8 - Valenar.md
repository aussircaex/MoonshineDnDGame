Known for: elves, horses, mercenaries.

The earliest migrations of elves to Khorvaire settled in Valenar. Over the millennia, they were driven out, and the elves spread around Khorvaire.

During the Last War, warlords from Aerenal seized the region from Cyre, invoking their ancient claim to the land. Since none of the surviving Five Nations had a claim to the land after Cyre's destruction, the Treaty of Thronehold recognized the new nation.

The Valenar are one of the few peoples who can directly compete with a Dragonmarked House in their own field - the Valenar's animal husbandry skills are tremendous, even rivaling [[Vadalis - Handling|House Vadalis's]] work in many respects.

The northern region of Valenar is the Blade Desert, forming a natural barrier between the rest of Khorvaire and the southern plains, and the elven warbands are masters of desert warfare in the defense of the nation.
