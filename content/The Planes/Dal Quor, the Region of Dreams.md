Dal Quor (DAL KWORE), the Region of Dreams is a plane that mortals visit when they dream. The plane is the home of the Quori, psychic nightmare beings who attempted to conquer Eberron long ago.  When a being sleeps, their minds are projected into Dal Quor, where the plane manifests their dreams and nightmares.

In ages past, the empire of Giants permanently threw Dal Quor off its orbit to halt the invasion. Since then, Dal Quor cannot be traveled to by any means, magical or mundane. The only way to visit it is in your dreams.

Example inhabitants: Quori, dreaming mortals.
