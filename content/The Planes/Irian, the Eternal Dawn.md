Irian (EAR-ee-an), the Eternal Dawn is the plane of positive energy. It is suffused with the magic energy that powers healing magics and allows for the birth of children, but also represents the concept of hopeful beginnings â€“ the brilliant white sun never sets, its fertile lands are untouched by tools, and its inhabitants live in perpetually young settlements and homesteads.

Irian is *coterminous* with Eberron for ten days in the springtime once every three years. During that time, the day is brighter, colors more vibrant, and sensations more intense.

Irian is *remote* from Eberron for ten days in the autumn once every three years; eighteen months before and after it is *coterminous*. During that time, the nights are darker, numbness hangs in the air, and healing magics are impeded.

Example inhabitants: lantern archons, celestials with healing magics
