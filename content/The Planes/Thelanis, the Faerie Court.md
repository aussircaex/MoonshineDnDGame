Thelanis (the-LAWN-iss) the Faerie Court, sometimes referred to as the Feywild, is home to faeries and all other fey beings. As such, it is a realm shaped by the narrative of stories and the games the fey play â€“ with one another, or with mortals as their victims. Its features depend on the whims of the archfey who lord over the region, but it commonly features lush forests, with trees of enchanting beauty surrounded by mesmerizing lights. Phosphorescence gleams on plants and stones, lighting the eternal twilight of the plane, while the sky is full of strange stars.

Time is chaotic on Thelanis, moving at different rates from realm to realm. Days or weeks of time on Eberron may pass in mere hours spent on Thelanis or the other way around. Sometimes this time difference is erased on return to Eberron, and sometimes not.

Example inhabitants: archfey, redcaps, dryads, nymphs, hags
