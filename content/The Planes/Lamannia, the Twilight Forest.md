Lamannia (la-MAHN-ee-ah), the Twilight Forest is a realm of raw unbounded nature, filled with all sorts of plants, animals, and magical beasts. It represents the concept of nature untouched by civilization, and is thus full of virgin forests, majestic mountains, rolling hills, steamy jungles, festering swamps, and all manner of terrain.

The plane actively resists any attempt at permanent construction â€“ permanent structures are inevitably destroyed by natural disaster.  It is home to the most primeval forms of life imaginable.

Lamannia is *coterminous* for one week every year in springtime, when the first full bloom of spring occurs. It is *remote* for one week in autumn, which signals the turn into cold weather.

Many werewolves and other lycanthropes fled to Lamannia during the Silver Crusade, forming a new community on the plane.

Example inhabitants: Giant animals, earth, air, and water elementals, lycanthropes.
