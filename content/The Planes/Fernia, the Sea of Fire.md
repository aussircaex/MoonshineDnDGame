Fernia (FERN-ee-ah), the Sea of Fire is a continually burning landscape composed almost entirely of magma and flame, with landmasses of compressed ash. It embodies fire in a literal sense and in a metaphorical sense, being a source of light, passion, industry, destruction, and change.

Fernia becomes *coterminous* with Eberron for a period of one month every five years, during midsummer. This produces heat waves, drought, and intense volcanic activity, but also artistic creativity, new romances, and social change. Fernia is *coterminous* at the same time that its counterpart Risia is *remote*.

Example inhabitants: Fire elementals, efreeti, fire-themed fiends, flame eladrin.
