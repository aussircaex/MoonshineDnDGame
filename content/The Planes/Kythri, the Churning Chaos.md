Kythri (KITH-ree), the Churning Chaos is the counterpart of Daanvi. The plane is a chaotic mass of all manner of elemental forces, which constantly collide and interact. Even gravity on Kythri changes randomly. While the plane is in a constant state of unrest, some beings can create small pockets of order by pure strength of will.

However, though it represents the concept of unpredictability, its elements are natural â€“ its blizzards are of snow, its floods are of water. The plane represents the unforseen, but not the implausible.

Kythri does not follow a set planar orbit but rather lurches through the Astral Plane at random intervals, so it might become *coterminous* or *remote* at any time, but it has no known effects on Eberron in any state.

Example inhabitants: Slaadi, githerzai, chaos beasts
