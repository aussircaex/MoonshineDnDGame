Daanvi (dah-AHN-vee), the Perfect Order is the manifestation of law among the planes orbiting Eberron. All things in Daanvi live in perfect harmony born of order. Daanvi is a plane of pure rules and order, where cleanly defined crops are farmed by hives of insect-like inhabitants. Battalions of angels patrol the skies of Daanvi, and welcome planar travelers and merchants.

Daanvi's orbit is an exact cycle of four hundred years: one hundred years where it is __coterminous__, one hundred years where it is __remote__, and two periods of one hundred years between as it waxes and wanes. Other than the effects this has on planar travel and manifest zones, however, Daanvi's _coterminousness_ has no apparent effect on Eberron.

Example inhabitants: Modrons, Archons, Devils, some Inevitables.
