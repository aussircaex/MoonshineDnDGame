Syrania (sih-RAHN-ee-uh), the Azure Sky is an endless expanse of blue skies. It is the plane of perfect peace â€“ on Syrania, large floating cities dot the skyline, and within those cities flourish all the things that prosper in peacetime: commerce bustles in its Immeasurable Market, institutes of learning teem with students, and spiritual thought and practices thrive.

When Syrania is *coterminous*, the skies become bluer, violent feelings are eased, and there is respite from war. When it is *remote*, the sky turns grey during the day and lightless black during at night. It is *coterminous* for one day every ten years, and five years before and after it is *remote* for one day.

Example inhabitants: angels.
