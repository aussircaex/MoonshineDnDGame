Xoriat (ZOR-ee-at), the Realm of Madness, is a plane that defies description. By merely visiting the plane, non-natives risk having their minds shattered at the sight of the chaos. A place of alien geometry and unspeakable inhabitants, the plane constantly bombards visitors with throes of madness, revealing truths, lies, and secrets.

However, unlike Kythri, Xoriat cannot be comprehended merely as place of chaos. True chaos could be understood as simple randomness â€“ Xoriat, however, always produces results that the mind believes it can comprehend, only to change the pattern at the last moment. It seeks to confound, to confuse, and to drive those within to madness.

Example inhabitants: beholders, mimics, mind flayers
