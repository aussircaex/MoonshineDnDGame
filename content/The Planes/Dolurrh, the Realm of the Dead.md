Dolurrh (DOH-lurr), the Realm of the Dead, is the place where the souls of most mortals go when they die â€“ neither as punishment nor reward. It is a place of apathy, hopelessness and eternal despair. Outsiders who visit are slowly overcome with ennui and eventually fade away, joining the dead. Some religions claim that adhering to their faiths provide alternatives to the oblivion of Dolurrh, but none can be proven.

Dolurrh becomes *coterminous* for one year, once every century. This occurs fifty years before and after a period of one year where it is *remote*. When Dolurrh is *coterminous*, spirits can pass easily into Eberron, causing a rise in hauntings. In addition, resurrection magics become dangerous, pulling more souls than intended back with them. When Dolurrh is *remote*, resurrections cannot be performed at all. 

Example inhabitants: souls of the dead, lemure devils, marut inevitables.
