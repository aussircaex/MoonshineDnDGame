Shavarath (SHAV-uh-rath), the Battleground is a region ever gripped in the throes of war as three groups vie for control of the plane: a host of celestial archons, an infernal regiment of devils, and a swarming horde of demons. The war has gone on as long as time and will continue until the end of all things, for the Shavarath represents the very concept of war and violence â€“ which can mean death, cruelty, and suffering, but also valor, honor, and the defense of freedom.

When the Shavarath is *coterminous*, tempers flare and people become quick to violence and revolution. It has no known effect for being *remote*.

Example inhabitants: Archons, devils, demons, yugoloths.
