*Note: everything I've written here is what you'd read in the rulebooks and online, but summarized to the basic elements*

**Creation Myth**: 
* The three Progenitor Dragons, named Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber, created the universe and the planes. Khyber attacked Siberys and tore him apart, and so Eberron wrapped herself around Khyber to trap her within herself. 
* Eberron's body is the planet, along with the sea, sky, and (ordinary) ground.
* Siberys is the heavens above, especially the Ring of Siberys, a planetary ring (like Saturn has) that rains down magical shards to this day.
* Khyber is the realm that other settings call the Underdark - deeper than simply being "underground", it is a magical place of demiplanes and pockets of strange landscapes. Fiends and monsters also originate here - which is to say, many demons and devils are "native" to Eberron, not from another plane (though there are also fiends on other planes like Fernia and the Shavarath).

**Age of Demons**: 
* Pre-history until ~100,000 years ago.
* The world was dominated by Khyber's spawn, and above all were the Overlords, godlike demons of immense power.
* The age ended when dragons and Siberys's children, the celestial couatls, rose to fight the Overlords. Most of the couatls sacrificed themselves to create the Silver Flame that imprisons the Overlords to this day.
* The religious belief of the Sovereign Host is that the fifteen Sovereigns lived and fought in this war.

**Age of Giants**:
* ~80,000-40,000 years ago.
* The various giantish people form a glorious civilization, mostly on the continent of Xen'drik.
* Their magics were drastically more powerful and grander than any that exist today.
* The giants were brilliant but cruel - they created the **elves** through their magical experiments and made them their slaves.
* Roughly 40,000 years ago, the plane of Dal Quor became *coterminous* with Eberron, and the Quori invaded. The resulting war devastated the giants, who called upon their most powerful magics to throw Dal Quor away from Eberron.
* This ended the invasion, but shattered the continent of Xen'drik
* The elves rebelled, and when the giants attempted to wield their devastating magic again, the dragons of Argonnessen attacked, and the giantish civilization fell.
* Some elves remained in Xen'drik, but others migrated to Aerenal, and eventually to Valenar and the rest of Khorvaire.

**Age of Monsters:**
* ~40,000-5,000 years ago
* On Khorvaire, goblinoids found kingdoms in what is now Breland and Darguun, and eventually are united into the great Dhakaani Empire.
* Orc nations arise in the west. A great dragon named Vvaraak teaches the orcs druidic magics, and they become the first Gatekeeper druids.
* Dragonborn found the empire of Q'barra in the east along with lizardfolk pushed into the region by Dhakaan.
* Dwarves migrate from the Frostfell (the north pole) to the Ironroot Mountains.
* Roughly 9,000 years ago, the plane of Xoriat became *coterminous* with Eberron, and the daelkyr invade.
* They are eventually defeated by the Gatekeeper druids, who close the portals to Xoriat and magically seal the daelkyr below ground.
* The Dhakaani empire crumbles over time.

**Current Age**:
* ~5000 years ago until present
* Between 4000 and 1000 years ago, the thirteen dragonmarks appear.
* ~3000 years ago, humans migrate from Sarlona to Khorvaire for the first time.
* ~2600 years ago, elves and dragons obliterate House Vol, and the entire bloodline bearing the Dragonmark of Death is exterminated. Only twelve dragonmarks exist to this day.
* ~2500 years ago, the first human settlements that will eventually become the Five Nations are founded.
* ~1500 years ago, the nation of Riedra is founded on distant Sarlona, and their oppression leads to a new wave of human and kalashtar migration to Khorvaire.
* ~1000 years ago, King Galifar I of Karrnath begins a war to unite the Five Nations. He offers the Dragonmarked Houses neutral status and economic freedoms in exchange for support.
* 998 years ago, Galifar wins the war and establishes the Kingdom of Galifar
* ~600 years ago, one of the demonic Overlords nearly broke free of its prison under Thrane. Paladin Tira Miron and her allies underwent a grand adventure to contain it, and Miron, along with one of the last surviving couatl, sacrificed their lives to re-seal the demon. While the Silver Flame existed since the end of the Age of Demons, this act marked the beginning of the formal worship of the Silver Flame as a religion unto itself.
* ~160 years ago, for reasons unknown, the curse of lycanthropy was intensified - peaceful natural-born werecreatures turned feral, they were unable to control their transformations, and the infection spread like wildfire. The Church of the Silver Flame enacted the Silver Purge, which ends the threat after 50 long years, destroying nearly all lycanthropes on Khorvaire. Many innocent victims were killed in the Purge, including shifters and "animal" folk like harengon, foxfolk, and tabaxi.
* 894 YK (104 years ago), King Jarot dies, and a war of succession breaks out. The conflict expands and continues for the following 100 years, becoming known as the Last War.
* 965 YK (33 years ago), House Cannith produces the first warforged and sells them to all sides of the War.
* 994 YK (4 years ago), the Day of Mourning occurs, destroying the entire nation of Cyre.
* 996 YK (2 years ago), the Treaty of Thronehold officially ends the Last War. The surviving of the Five Nations of Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, and Thrane recognize a number of sovereign nations that fought for their independence during the war, including Zilargo, the Talenta Plains, Q'Barra, the Eldeen Reaches, Darguun, and Valenar.
* The treaty also grants the warforged full rights and independence and orders Cannith to destroy their creation forges.
* 998 YK - present day.
